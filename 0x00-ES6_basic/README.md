# 0x00-ES6_basic

## Overview

This directory contains tasks and exercises related to ES6 basics as part of the **ALX Backend JavaScript** curriculum. The focus of this project is to help understand the fundamental features of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), including syntax improvements, new functions, and other updates introduced in this version of JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The files in this directory are as follows:

- **0-constants.js**: A script to demonstrate the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- **1-block-scoped.js**: A script explaining block scope and the difference between block-scoped and function-scoped variables.
- **2-arrow.js**: A script introducing arrow functions in ES6.
- **3-default-parameter.js**: A script showing how to use default parameters in functions.
- **4-rest-parameter.js**: A script that explains the use of rest parameters.
- **5-spread-operator.js**: A script demonstrating the spread operator for arrays and objects.
- **6-string-interpolation.js**: A script that shows how to use string interpolation with template literals.
- **7-for-of.js**: A script to explain the usage of the `for...of` loop.
- **8-computed-property.js**: A script demonstrating the use of computed property names.
- **9-symbols.js**: A script introducing `Symbol` data type in ES6.
- **100-map.js**: A script explaining the new `Map` object in ES6.
- **101-weak-map.js**: A script explaining the `WeakMap` object.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use block-scoped variables (`let` and `const`).
- Use arrow functions and understand their lexical scoping.
- Work with default and rest parameters in functions.
- Use the spread operator for arrays and objects.
- Implement string interpolation with template literals.
- Iterate over arrays and collections with `for...of`.
- Understand computed property names.
- Use ES6's `Map` and `WeakMap` objects.
- Utilize the `Symbol` primitive for unique values.

## Installation
